##
About The Project

This project is a **professional landing page** designed for Abun.com, an AI content writing platform that helps users create SEO-optimized articles. The goal was to create a modern, clean, and fully responsive website that showcases the product's features and encourages users to sign up.

This was built as part of my **web development internship assignment** where I was tasked to create a production-ready landing page using React.js and modern web technologies.

### Why This Project?

- To showcase my **React.js skills** (hooks, component architecture, state management)
- To demonstrate my ability to build **responsive, pixel-perfect UIs**
- To practice **real-world development workflows** (component reusability, clean code)
- To build a strong **portfolio project** for job applications
